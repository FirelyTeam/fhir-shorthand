### Introduction

FHIR Shorthand (FSH) is a domain-specific language (DSL) for defining the content of FHIR Implementation Guides (IG). It is simple and compact, with tools to produce [Health Level Seven (HL7®) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) profiles, extensions and implementation guides (IG). Because it is written in text statements, FHIR Shorthand encourages distributed, team-based development using conventional source code control tools such as Github.

> **NOTE**: HL7® and FHIR® are registered trademarks owned by Health Level Seven International.

#### Motivations for FHIR Shorthand

1. The FHIR community needs scalable, fast, and user-friendly tools for IG creation and maintenance. Profiling projects can be difficult and slow, and the resulting IG quality can be inconsistent.
1. Editing StructureDefinitions (SDs) by hand is complex and unwieldy.
1. Available tools such as Forge, Trifolia-on-FHIR, and Excel spreadsheets improve this situation, but still have drawbacks:
    1. Although the tools provide a friendlier interface, the user must still understand many SD details.
    1. The tools are not particularly agile when it comes to [refactoring](https://resources.collab.net/agile-101/code-refactoring).
    1. Source code control (SCC) features such as version-to-version differences and merging changes are not well supported.
1. It can be difficult make sense of the Profile pages in IGs ([see this example from the September 2019 ballot](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/breast-radiology/2019Sep/StructureDefinition-breastrad-BreastRadiologyDocument.html)). FSH compiles to SD, but FSH itself is clearer and more compact and could represent the snapshot and differential.
1. Experience has shown that complex software projects are best approached with textual languages. As a DSL designed for the job of profiling and IG creation, FSH is concise, understandable, and aligned to user intentions.
1. FSH is ideal for SCC, with meaningful version-to-version differentials, support for merging and conflict resolution, and refactoring through global search/replace operations. These features allow FSH to scale in ways that other approaches cannot.

#### Benefits of FHIR Shorthand

* Agile -- rapid refactoring and revision cycles
* Readable and easy to understand
* Makes the author’s intent clear
* Reduces implementation errors
* Enforces consistency by compiling FSH into FHIR artifacts using consistent patterns
* Provides meaningful differentials in SCC
* Enables merging at the statement/line-level in SCC
* Supports distributed development under SCC
* Any text editor can be used to modify an FSH file, but editing environments such as VS Code and Notepad++ can provide text colorization, look-ahead syntax, go-to-definition, etc.

#### Versioning

The FSH specification, like other IGs, follows the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) convention (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

* MAJOR: A major release has significant new functionality and potentially, grammar changes or other non-backward-compatible changes.
* MINOR: Contains new or modified features, while maintaining backwards compatibility within the major version.
* PATCH: Contains minor updates and bug fixes, while maintaining backwards compatibility within the major version.

For a full change log, see the [FHIR Shorthand Release Notes](_#missing link_).

### Language Elements

This section describes various parts of the FSH language.

#### File Types and FSH Tanks

Information in FSH is stored in plain text files with _.fsh_ extension. How information is divided between files is up to the user. One approach is to put profiles in one file, value sets another, extensions in another, etc. Another approach is to put all items related to a single topic in a single file, grouping related profiles, extensions, invariants, and examples. Both approaches, or something entirely different, will work.

A **FSH Tank** is a folder that contains FSH files. A FSH Tank corresponds one-to-one to an IG and represents a complete module that can be placed under SCC. The contents of the IG (profiles, extensions, value sets, examples, narrative content, etc.) are determined by the contents of the directory/folder that contains the Configuration file. Anything else is "external" and must be declared in dependencies.

#### Formal Grammar

[FSH has a formal grammar](_#missing link_) defined in an [ANTLR4 grammar](https://www.antlr.org/).

#### Reserved Words

FSH has a number of reserved words (e.g., `boolean`, `or`, `from`, `contains`, `obeys`). For a complete list of reserved words, refer to [FSH's formal ANTLR4 grammar](_#missing link_).

#### Primitives

The primitive data types and value formats in FSH are identical to the [primitive types and value formats in FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#primitive).

For editing purposes, FSH also supports multi-line strings, using triple quotation marks `"""` instead of single quotation marks. The line breaks are for visual convenience only; the definition of the string is not affected.

#### Whitespace

Repeated whitespace is not meaningful within FSH files. This:

```
Profile:  SecondaryCancerCondition
Parent:   CancerCondition
* focus only PrimaryCancerCondition
```

is equivalent to:

```
              Profile:  
SecondaryCancerCondition   Parent: CancerCondition

         * focus only    
PrimaryCancerCondition
```

#### Comments

FSH follows [JavaScript syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comments.asp) for code comments:

```
// Use a double-slash for comments on a single line

/*
Use slash-asterisk and asterisk-slash for larger block comments.
These comments can take up multiple lines.
*/
```

#### Coded Data Types

FSH provides special grammar for expressing coded types. Coded types include code, Coding, CodeableConcept, and Quantity.

##### code

Codes are denoted with `#` sign. The shorthand is:

`#{code}`

>**NOTE**: In this document, curly brackets are used to indicate a term that should be substituted.

**Example**

  `#confirmed`

##### Coding

The shorthand for Coding is:

`{system}#{code} "{display text}"`

A less-common form is:

`{system}|{version}#{code} "{display text}"`

While `{system}` and `{code}` are required, `|{version}` and `"{display text}"` are optional. The `{system}`, which represents the controlled terminology that the code is taken from, can be a URL, OID, or alias. Aliases must be declared in the file header using the [`Alias`](#defining-aliases) keyword. The bar syntax for code system version is the same approach used in the `canonical` data type in FHIR.

**Examples**

  `SCT#363346000 "Malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)"  // SCT is an alias`

  `http://snomed.info/sct#363346000 "Malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)"`

  `ICD10CM#C004  "Malignant neoplasm of lower lip, inner aspect" // ICD10CM is an alias`

  `http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/example-supplement|201801103#chol-mmol`

To set the less-common properties of a Coding, use a [fixed value rule](#fixed-value-rules), for example::

  `* myCoding.userSelected = true`

For code systems that encode the version separately from the URL, the version can be specified either using the bar syntax, as above, or by setting the `version` element of Coding in a fixed value rule:

`* myCoding.version = "1.0.2"`


##### CodeableConcept

The shorthand for a CodeableConcept is similar to that for Coding. For example, to set Condition.code:

`* code = SCT#363346000 "Malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)"`

which is interpreted as the first Coding in the CodeableConcept.Coding array,equivalent to:

`* code.coding[0] = SCT#363346000 "Malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)"`

To fix the top-level text of a CodeableConcept, use a fixed-value rule:

`* code.text = "Diagnosis of malignant neoplasm left breast."`

To specify alternative Codings in Condition.code, specify the array index:

`* code.coding[1] = ICD10#C80.1 "Malignant (primary) neoplasm, unspecified"`

> **Note:** FSH arrays are zero-based.

##### Quantity

A FHIR Quantity can be fixed like a CodeableConcept or bound to a value set. The binding or coded value is interpreted as the units of measure of that Quantity. To make this more intuitive, FSH uses the reserved word `units`, as follows:

`* {Quantity type} units from {value set}`

`* {Quantity type} units = {system}#{code} "{display text}"`

`* {Quantity type} units = '{Any UCUM unit}'`

>**NOTE:** Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) is implicit when single quotes are used

**Examples**

`* valueQuantity units from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/distance-units`

`* valueQuantity units = http://unitsofmeasure.org#mm "millimeters"`

`* valueQuantity units = 'mm'`  

#### Paths

FSH path grammar allows you to refer to any element of a profile, extension, or profile, regardless of nesting. Paths also provide a grammar for addressing elements of a SD directly. Here are a few examples of how paths are used in FSH:

* To refer to a nested element, such as method.text in Observation
* To address a particular item in a list or array
* To refer to individual elements inside choice elements (e.g., onsetAge in onset[x])
* To pick out an individual item within a multiple choice reference, such as Observation in Reference(Observation | Condition)
* To refer to an individual slice within a sliced array, such as the SystolicBP component within a blood pressure
* To set metadata elements in SD, like StructureDefinition.active
* To address elements of ElementDefinitions associated with a SD, such as maxLength property of string elements

##### Nested Property Paths

To refer to simple or nested properties, the path lists the properties in order, separated by a dot (.) 

For example, Observation has a method property, and method (a CodeableConcept) has a text property, then the path is `method.text`, e.g.:

`* method.text = "Laparoscopy"`

In this example, the root Observation is inferred from the context and not a formal part of the path. In this way, it differs from the path element in StructureDefinitions.

> **NOTE:** It is not possible to cross reference boundaries when profiling (except for slice discriminators, which may `resolve()` references). This means that when a path gets to a Reference, that path cannot be nested any further.  For example, if Procedure has a subject, and subject is Reference(Patient) which has a gender property, then `Procedure.subject` is a valid path, but `Procedure.subject.gender` is not, because it crosses into the Patient reference.

##### Array Property Paths

If a property allows more than one value (e.g., `0..*`), then it must be possible to address each individual value. This is mainly necessary when creating instances, but may be needed in other contexts as well. FSH denotes this with square brackets (`[` `]`) containing the **0-based** index of the item (e.g., first item is `[0]`, second item is `[1]`, etc.).

If the index is omitted, the first element of the array (`[0]`) is assumed. 

**Example** Set a Patient's first name's second given name to "Marie":

`* name[0].given[1] = "Marie"`

or, since the zero index is assumed when omitted:

`* name.given[1] = "Marie"`

##### Reference Paths

Frequently in FHIR, an element has a Reference that has multiple targets. To address a specific target, follow the path with square brackets (`[` `]`) containing the target type (or the profile's `name`, `id`, or `url`).

**Example** Restrict a performer element (type Reference(Organization | Pracititioner) to PrimaryCareProvider in a profile, assuming PrimaryCareProvider is a profile on Practitioner:

`* performer[Practitioner] only PrimaryCareProvider`

##### Data Type Choice ([x]) Paths

Addressing a type from a choice of types replaces the `[x]` in the property name with the type name (while also capitalizing the first letter). This follows the approach used in FHIR JSON and XML serialization.

**Example** Fix value[x] string property to "Hello World":

`* valueString = "Hello World"`

##### Profiled Type Choice Paths

In some cases, a type may be constrained to a set of possible profiles. To address a specific profile on that type, follow the path with square brackets (`[` `]`) containing the profile's `name`, `id`, or `url`.

**Example** In an instance, set the address.state property to the code for Massachusetts (assumes the address type indicates several profiles, one being USAddress):

`* address[USAddress].state = UspsTwoLetterAlphabeticCodes#MA`

> **NOTE:** The example above assumes the context of an instance.  If we were trying to constrain the state only in the USAddress profile (and other profiles of Address were possible), then this would actually be slicing, and slicing syntax should be used.

##### Sliced Array Paths

FHIR allows lists to be compartmentalized into sublists called "slices".  For example, the Observation.component list in a profile for Apgar score might have a RespiratoryScore component slice and a Appearance component slice, among others.  To address a specific slice, follow the path with square brackets (`[` `]`) containing the slice name.  To access a slice of a slice (i.e., _reslicing_), follow the first pair of brackets with a second pair containing the resliced slice name.

**Example** Fix the code in an existing slice on Observation.component called `RespiratoryScore`:

`* component[RespiratoryScore].code = SCT#24388001 "Apgar score 5 (finding)"`

**Example** If the Apgar RespiratoryScore has been resliced to represent the 1, 5 and 10 minute scores:

`* component[RespiratoryScore][FiveMinute].code = SCT#13323003 "Apgar score 7 (finding)"`

##### Extension Paths

Extensions are arrays populated by slicing. They may be addressed using the slice path syntax presented above. However, extensions being very common in FHIR, FSH supports a compact syntax for paths that involve extensions. The compact syntax drops `extension[ ]` or `modifierExtension[ ]` (similar to the way the `[0]` index can be dropped). The only time this is not allowed is when dropping these terms creates a naming conflict.

**Example** Explicit path syntax for extensions within US Core Patient:

```
* extension[us-core-ethnicity].extension[ombCategory].valueCoding = RACE#2135-2 "Hispanic or Latino"
* extension[us-core-ethnicity].extension[detailed][0].valueCoding = RACE#2184-0 "Dominican"
* extension[us-core-ethnicity].extension[detailed][1].valueCoding = RACE#2148-5 "Mexican"
* extension[us-core-ethnicity].extension[text].valueString = "Hispanic or Latino"
* extension[us-core-birthsex].valueCode = #F
```

**Example** (Preferred) Abbreviated grammar addressing extensions in US Core Patient:
```
* us-core-ethnicity.ombCategory.valueCoding = RACE#2135-2 "Hispanic or Latino"
* us-core-ethnicity.detailed[0].valueCoding = RACE#2184-0 "Dominican"
* us-core-ethnicity.detailed[1].valueCoding = RACE#2148-5 "Mexican"
* us-core-ethnicity.text.valueString = "Hispanic or Latino"
* us-core-birthsex.valueCode = #F
```

##### Structure Definition Escape Paths

FSH uses the caret (^) syntax to provide direct access to any element in StructureDefinition. The caret syntax is the method for setting metadata attributes in SD (attributes not associated with any element). The caret syntax can be combined with non-caret (element) paths to set values in the SD associated with a particular element (see example below).

**Example** Setting metadata attributes in a profile:

```
Profile:       USCorePatient
Parent:        Patient
Description:   "Defines constraints and extensions on the patient resource for the minimal set of data to query and retrieve patient demographic information."
Id: "us-core-patient"
* ^status = #active
* ^experimental = false
```

**Example** Addressing SD attributes in an individual element definition:
```
Profile:        USCorePatient
Parent:         Patient
* communication.language ^binding.extension[0].url = "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet"
```
***
### Rules

Rules are the mechanism for constraining a profile, defining an extension, creating slices, and more. All rules begin with an asterisk:

`* {rule statement}`

Here is a summary of the rules supported in FSH:

| Rule Type | Rule Syntax | Examples |
| --- | --- |---|
| Fixed value |`* {path} = {value}`  | `* experimental = true` <br/> `* status = #active` <br/> `* valueString = "foo"` <br/> `* valueQuantity.value = 1.23` |
| Value set binding |`* {path} from {valueSet} ({strength})`| `* telecom.system from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/contact-point-system (required)`
| Narrowing cardinality | `* {path} {min}..{max}` | `* identifier 1..*` <br/> `* identifier.system 1..1`
| Data type restriction | `* {path} only {type1} or {type2} or {type3}` | `* value[x] only code` <br/> `* value[x] only code or Quantity` |
| Reference type restriction | `* {path} only Reference({type1} | {type2} | {type3})` | `* subject only Reference(Patient)` <br/> `* basedOn only Reference(MedicationRequest | ServiceRequest)` |
| Flag assignment | `* {path} {flag1} {flag2}` <br/> `* {path1}, {path2}, {path3}... {flag}` | `* communication MS ?!` <br> `* identifier, identifier.system, identifier.value, name, name.family MS`
| Invariants | `* obeys {invariant}` <br/> `* {path} obeys {invariant}` <br/> `* {path1}, {path2}, ... obeys {invariant}` | `* name obeys USCoreNameInvariant` |
| Slicing | `* {array element path} contains {sliceName1} {card1} {flags1} and {sliceName2} {card2} {flags2}...` | `* component contains SystolicBP 1..1 MS and DiastolicBP 1..1 MS` |
| Extensions | `* {extension element path} contains {extensionName1} {card1} and {extensionName2} {card2} ...` | `* extension contains TreatmentIntent 0..1 and RadiationDose 0..1` |
| Mapping | `* {path} -> {string}` | `* identifier.value -> "identifier.value"` |
{: .grid }

#### Fixed Value Rules

Fixed value assignments follow this syntax:

`* {path} = {value}`

The left side of the expression follows the [FSH path grammar](#paths). The value have a data type aligned with the last element in the path.

Assignment of coded types can use the [shorthand for coded data types](#coded-data-types). 

**Examples**

`* status = #arrived`

`* code = SCT#363346000 "Malignant neoplastic disease (disorder)"`

`* active = true`

`* onsetDateTime = "2019-04-02"`

`* valueQuantity = 36.5 'C'`

In instances, there may be fixed value rules that represent references to other instances. In this case, the fact that the value is a reference is known from the SD, and only the name of the referenced instance is given.

**Example** Fixing a references appearing in an instance:

`* subject = EveAnyperson  // not Reference(EveAnyperson)`


#### Value Set Binding Rules

Binding is the process of associating a coded element with a set of possible values. The syntax to bind a value set, or alter an inherited binding, uses the reserved word `from`:

`* {path} from {valueSet} ({strength})`

The value set can be the name of a value set defined in the same FSH tank, or the defining URL of an external value set that is part of the core FHIR spec, or an IG that has been declared a dependency in the _package.json_ file.

The strengths are the same as the [binding strengths defined in FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-binding-strength.html), namely: example, preferred, extensible, and required.

The following rules apply to binding in FSH:

* If no binding strength is specified, the binding is assumed to be required.
* When further constraining an existing binding, the binding strength can stay the same or be made tighter (e.g., replacing a preferred binding with extensible or required), but never loosened.
* Constraining may leave the binding strength the same and change the value set instead. However, certain changes permitted in FSH may violate [FHIR profiling principles](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#binding-strength). In particular, FHIR will permit a required value set to be replaced by another required value set only if the codes in the new value set are a subset of the codes in the original value set. For extensible bindings, the new value set can contain codes not in the existing value set, but additional codes **should not** have the same meaning as existing codes in the base value set.

**Examples**

`* telecom.system from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/contact-point-system (required)`

`* gender from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/administrative-gender`

`* address.state from USPSTwoLetterAlphabeticCodes (extensible)`

#### Narrowing Cardinality Rules

Cardinality rules constrain the number of repetitions of an element. Every element has a cardinality inherited from its parent resource or profile. If the inheriting profile does not alter the cardinality, no cardinality rule is required.

To change the cardinality, the grammar is:

`* {path} {min}..{max}`

As in FHIR, min and max are integers, and max can be *, representing unbounded.

Cardinalities must follow [rules of FHIR profiling](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/conformance-rules.html#cardinality), namely that the min and max cardinalities must stay within the constraints of the parent.

**Examples**

`* subject 1..1`

`* component.referenceRange 0..0`

#### Data Type Restriction Rules

Certain elements in FHIR offer a choice of data types using the [x] syntax. For example, Condition.onset[x] is a choice of dateTime, Age, Period, Range or string.

The syntax for narrowing the choices in a profile uses the `only` reserved word:

 `* {path} only {type1} or {type2} or {type3}...`

These choices can be restricted in two ways: reducing the number or choices, or substituting a profile of one of the choices. For example, if one of the choices is Quantity, it can be replaced by SimpleQuantity, since SimpleQuantity is a profile on Quantity (hence more restrictive than Quantity itself). 

**Examples**

`* onset[x] only dateTime`

`* onset[x] only Period or Range`

`* onset[x] only Age or AgeRange  // where AgeRange is a profile on Range`

#### Reference Type Restriction Rules

Elements that refer to other resources often offer a choice of target resource types. For example, Condition.recorder has reference type choice Reference(Practitioner | PractitionerRole | Patient | RelatedPerson). A reference type restriction rule can narrow these choices, using the following grammar:

* `{path} only Reference({type1} | {type2} | {type3} ...)`

> **NOTE:** The vertical bar within references represents logical 'or'.

**Examples** Alternative ways to restrict the type of Condition.recorder, assuming `PrimaryCarePhysician` and `EmergencyRoomPhysician` are profiles on `Practitioner`:

`* recorder only Reference(Practitioner)`

`* recorder only Reference(Practitioner | PractitionerRole)`

`* recorder only Reference(PrimaryCarePhysician | EmergencyRoomPhysician | PractitionerRole)`

> **NOTE**: A reference can only be restricted to a compatible type. For example, the subject of [US Core Condition](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-condition.html), with type Reference(US Core Patient), cannot be restricted to Reference(Patient), because Patient is not a profile of US Core Patient.

#### Flag Assignment Rules

Flags are a set of information about the element that impacts how implementers handle them. The [flags defined in FHIR](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/formats.html#table), and the symbols used to describe them, as as follows:

| FHIR Flag | FSH Flag | Meaning |
|------|-----|----|
| S | MS  | Must Support |
| &#931;  | SU  | Include in summary |
| ?! | ?! | Modifier |
{: .grid }

The flags I, NE, TU, N, and D are currently not supported by FSH.

The following syntax can be used to assigning flags:

`* {path} {flag1} {flag2} ...`

`* {path1}, {path2}, {path3}... {flag}`

**Examples**

`* communication MS ?!`

`* identifier, identifier.system, identifier.value, name, name.family MS`

#### Invariant Rules

[Invariants](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/conformance-rules.html#constraints) are constraints that apply to one or more values in instances, expressed as [FHIRPath expressions](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/fhirpath.html). An invariant can apply to an instance as a whole, a single element, or multiple elements. The FSH grammars for applying invariants in profiles are as follows:

`* obeys {invariant}`

`* {path} obeys {invariant}`

`* {path1}, {path2}, ... obeys {invariant}`

The first case is where the invariant applies to the profile as a whole. The second is where the invariant applies to a single element, and the third is where the invariant applies to multiple elements.

The referenced invariant and its properties must be declared somewhere within the same FSH tank, using the `Invariant` keyword. See [Defining Invariants](#defining-invariants).

**Examples**

`* name obeys USCoreNameInvariant`

#### Slicing Rules

The subject of slicing is addressed three steps: (1) specifying the slices, (2) defining slice contents, and (3) providing the slicing logic.

##### Step 1. Specifying Slices

Slices are specified using the `contains` keyword. The following syntax is used to create new slices:

```
* {array element path} contains {sliceName1} {card1} {flags1} and {sliceName2} {card2} {flags2} and ...
```
In this pattern, the `{array element path}` is a path to an element with multiple cardinality that is to be sliced, `{card}` is required, and `{flags}` are optional.

**Example** Slice Observation.component:
```
* component contains SystolicBP 1..1 MS and DiastolicBP 1..1 MS
```

Because FSH is white-space invariant, this can be written so the slices appear one-per-line for readability:
```
* component contains
    SystolicBP 1..1 and
    DiastolicBP 1..1
```
###### Reslicing

Reslicing (slicing an existing slice) uses a similar syntax, but the left-hand side uses [slice path syntax](#sliced-array-paths) to refer to the slice that is being resliced:
```
* {array element path}[{sliceName}] contains {resliceName1} {card1} and {resliceName2} {card2} and ...
```

##### Step 2. Defining Slice Contents

There are two approaches to defining the slices themselves:

1. Define the slice details inline in the profile. This approach is applicable when the structure of the slice already exists, in particular, when slicing a backbone element such as Observation.component.
2. Define the slice as a separate item. This approach is required when the structure of the slice needs to be defined, and when slicing an array that involves a reference, such as Observation.hasMember.

The syntax for inline definition of slices is the same as constraining any other path in a profile, but uses the [slice path syntax](#sliced-array-paths) in the path:

```
* {path to slice}.{subpath} {constraint}
```

**Example** Defining SystolicBP and DiastolicBP slices inline:
```
* component contains SystolicBP 1..1 and DiastolicBP 1..1
* component[SystolicBP].code = LNC#8480-6 "Systolic blood pressure"
* component[SystolicBP].value[x] only Quantity
* component[SystolicBP].valueQuantity units = UCUM#mm[Hg] "mmHg"
* component[DiastolicBP].code = LNC#8462-4 "Diastolic blood pressure"
* component[DiastolicBP].value[x] only Quantity
* component[DiastolicBP].valueQuantity units = UCUM#mm[Hg] "mmHg"
```

##### Step 3. Providing the Slicing Logic

Slicing in FHIR requires the user to specify a [discriminator path and discriminator type](http://www.hl7.org/fhiR/profiling.html#discriminator). Optionally, you can also declare the slice open or closed, ordered or unordered.

One way to specify these parameters is to use [structure definition escape (caret) syntax](#structure-definition-escape-paths). The author identifies the sliced element, and then traverses the structure definition at that point.

**Example**
```
* component[0] ^discriminator[0].type = #pattern
* component[0] ^discriminator[0].path = "code"
* component[0] ^ordered = false
* component[0] ^rules = #open
* component[0] ^description = "Slice based on the component.code pattern"
```

The second approach, nicknamed "Ginsu Slicing" for the [amazing 1980's TV knife that slices through anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wzULnlHr8w), is provided by SUSHI and requires no action by the user. SUSHI infers slicing discriminators based the nature of the slices, based on a set of explicit algorithms. For more information, see the[SUSHI documentation](sushi.html).

#### Extension Rules

Extensions are created by slicing the extension array that is present at the root level of every resource, in each element, and recursively in each extension. Since extensions are essentially a special case of slicing, the slicing syntax can be reused. However, it is **not** necessary to specify the discriminator, since the discriminator is always the identifying URL of the extension.

Extensions can be created by slicing the `extension` (or `modifierExtension`) array, for example:

```
* extension contains
    USCoreRaceExtension 0..1 MS and
    USCoreEthnicityExtension 0..1 MS and
    USCoreBirthsexExtension 0..1 MS
```
Slicing an extension element below the root level is achieved by giving the full path to the extension array to be sliced.

#### Mapping Rules

[Mappings](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mappings.html) are an optional part of SDs that can be provided to help implementers understand the content and use resources correctly. These mappings are informative and are not to be confused with the computable mappings provided by [FHIR Mapping Language](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mapping-language.html) and the [StructureMap resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/structuremap.html).

Mapping rules use the symbol `->` with the following grammar:

`* {path} -> {string}`

**Example**

### Defining Items in FHIR Shorthand

This section shows how to define various items in FSH:

* [Aliases](#defining-aliases)
* [Profiles](#defining-profiles)
* [Slices](#defining-slices)
* [Extensions](#defining-extensions)
* [Mappings](#defining-mappings)
* [Mixins](#defining-mixins)
* [Invariants](#defining-invariants)
* [Instances](#defining-instances)
* [Code Systems](#defining-code-systems)
* [Value Sets](#defining-value-sets)

#### Keywords

Keywords are used to make declarations that introduce new items, such as profiles and instances. For each item defined in FSH, a keyword section is first followed by a number of rules. The keyword statements themselves follow the syntax:

`{Keyword}: {value}`

For example:

`Profile: SecondaryCancerCondition`

`Description: "The intent of the treatment."`

For some keywords, values are **FSH names**. A name is any sequence of non-whitespace characters, used to refer to the item within the same [FSH tank](#file-types-and-fsh-tanks). By convention, names should use [PascalCase (also known as UpperCamelCase)](https://wiki.c2.com/?UpperCamelCase).

The use of individual keywords is explained in greater detail in the following sections. Here is a summary of keywords in FSH:

| Keyword | Purpose | Data Type |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `Alias`| Defines an alias for a URL or OID | uri, url, or oid  |
| `CodeSystem` | Declares a new code system | name |
| `Description` | Provides a human-readable description | string, markdown |
| `Expression` | The FHIR path expression in an invariant | string |
| `Extension` | Declares a new extension | name |
| `Id` | Set a unique identifier of an item | name |
| `Instance` | Declare a new instance | name |
| `InstanceOf` | The profile or resource an instance instantiates | name |
| `Invariant` | Declares a new invariant | name |
| `Mapping` | Introduces a new mapping | name |
| `Mixin` | Introduces a class to be used as a mixin | name |
| `Mixins` | Declares mix-in constraints in a profile | name or names (comma separated) |
| `Language` | Declares the language of texts in a localization file | language ISO code |
| `Parent` | Specifies the base class for a profile or extension | name |
| `Profile` | Introduces a new profile | name |
| `Severity` | error, warning, or guideline in invariant | code |
| `Slice` | Introduces a new slice | name, string |
| `Source` | Profile or path a mapping applies to | path |
| `Target` | The standard that the mapping maps to | string |
| `Title` | Short human-readable name | string |
| `ValueSet` | Declares a new value set | name |
| `XPath` | the xpath in invariant | string |
{: .grid }


#### Defining Aliases

Aliases are a convenience measure that allows the user to replace a lengthy url or oid with a short string. By convention, an alias name is written in all capitals. A typical use of an alias is to represent a code system.

Defining an alias is a one-line declaration, as follows:

`Alias: {NAME} = {url or oid}`

**Examples**

`Alias: SCT = http://snomed.info/sct`

`Alias: RACE = urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.6.238`

#### Defining Profiles

To define a profile, the keywords `Profile`, `Parent` are required, and `Id`, `Title`, and `Description` should be used. The keyword `Mixins` is optional.

**Example**

```
Profile:        USCorePatient
Parent:         Patient
Id:             us-core-patient
Title:          "US Core Patient Profile"
Description:    "Defines constraints and extensions on the patient resource for the minimal set of data to query and retrieve patient demographic information."
```
Any rules defined for the profiles would follow immediately after the keyword section.

##### Mixins
Mixins have the ability to take rules defined in one class and apply them to a compatible class. The rules are copied from the source class at compile time. Although there can only be one `Parent` class, there can be multiple `Mixins`.

Each mixin class must be compatible parent class, in the sense that all the extensions and constraints defined in the mixin class apply to elements actually present in the Parent class. The legality of a mixin is checked at compile time, with an error signaled if the mixin class is not compatible with the parent class. For example, an error would signalled if there was an attempt to mix a Condition into an Observation.

At present, mixin classes must be defined in FSH. The capability for mixing in externally-defined classes is under development.

**Example** Defining two national IGs, both based on the same BreastRadiologyProfile:

```
Profile: USCoreBreastRadiologyProfile
Parent: BreastRadiologyProfile
Mixins:  USCoreObservation

Profile: FranceBreastRadiologyProfile
Parent: BreastRadiologyProfile
Mixins: FranceCoreObservation
```

> **IMPORTANT**: To be a valid mixin, the mixin cannot inherit from a different resource.

#### Defining Slices

We saw earlier how to use `contains` rules and constraints to [define inline slices](#step-2-defining-slice-contents). Alternatively, it might be clearer to define each slice as an independent, modular entity. Defining slices outside a particular profile also allows the slices to be reused in multiple contexts.

The syntax for defining a slice is the same as for FSH profiles, except that the initial keyword is `Slice` and the SD escape (^) cannot be used, since slices do not have separate SDs.

**Example** Slices declared in the BloodPressure profile:

```
Slice:     SystolicBP
Parent:    Observation.component
Description: "The blood pressure during left ventricle contraction"
* code = LNC#8480-6 "Systolic blood pressure"
* value[x] only Quantity
* valueQuantity units = UCUM#mm[Hg] "mmHg"

Slice:    DiastolicBP
Parent:   Observation.component
Description: "The blood pressure when the heart rests between beats"
* code = LNC#8462-4 "Diastolic blood pressure"
* value[x] only Quantity
* valueQuantity units = UCUM#mm[Hg] "mmHg"
```

Note that since Observation.component is a BackboneElement, the example above must use the path `Observation.component` for the `Parent` value. It is also possible to specify a FHIR complex data type as the value for `Parent`.  This would allow the slice to be used wherever there is an array of that type.  For example:

```
Slice:    NPI
Parent:   Identifier
Description: "The U.S. National Provider Identifier (NPI)"
* system = http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-npi
```

#### Defining Extensions

Defining extensions is similar to defining a profile, except that the parent of extension is not required. Extensions can also inherit from other extensions, but if the `Parent` keyword is omitted, the parent is assumed to be FHIR's [Extension element](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility.html#extension). 

> **NOTE:** All extensions have the same structure, but extensions can either have a value (i.e. a value[x] element) or sub-extensions, but not both. To create a complex extension, the extension array of the extension must be sliced (see example, below).

**Example** Define simple extension:

```
Extension:      USCoreBirthSexExtension 
Id:             us-core-birthsex
Title:          "US Core Birth Sex Extension"
Description:     "A code classifying the person's sex assigned at birth"
// publisher, contact, and other metadata here using caret (^) syntax (omitted)
* value[x] only code
* valueCode from BirthSex (required)
```

**Example** Define complex extension:
```
Extension:      USCoreEthnicityExtension
Id:             us-core-ethnicity
Title:          "US Core Ethnicity Extension"
Description:    "Concepts classifying the person into a named category of humans sharing common history, traits, geographical origin or nationality. "
* extension contains 
    ombCategory 0..1 MS and 
    detailed 0..* and 
    text 1..1 MS
// inline definition of sub-extensions
* extension[ombCategory] ^short = "Hispanic or Latino|Not Hispanic or Latino"
* extension[ombCategory].value[x] only Coding
* extension[ombCategory].valueCoding from OmbEthnicityCategories (required)
* extension[detailed] ^short = "Extended ethnicity codes"
* extension[detailed].value[x] only Coding
* extension[detailed].valueCoding from DetailedEthnicity (required)
* extension[text] ^short = "Ethnicity text"
* extension[text].value[x] only string
```

**Example**  Extension with explicit parent:

```
Extension:      BinaryBirthSexExtension
Parent:         USCoreBirthSexExtension
Id:             binary-birthsex
Title:          "Binary Birth Sex Extension"
Description:     "As of 2019, certain US states only allow M or F on birth certificates."
* valueCode from BinaryBirthSex (required)
```

#### Defining Mappings

[Mappings to other standards](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mappings.html) are an optional part of a SD. These mappings are informative and are provided to help implementers understand the content of the SD and use the profile or resource correctly. While it is possible for profile authors to include mappings using escape syntax, FSH provides a more modular approach.

> **NOTE:** The informational mappings in SDs should not be confused with functional mappings provided by [FHIR Mapping Language](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mapping-language.html) and the [StructureMap resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/structuremap.html).

To create a mapping, the keywords `Mapping`, `Source`, `Target` and `Id` are used. Any number of [mapping rules](#mapping-rules) then follow.

**Example**  // MK -- NOTE -- I made some changes -- to be checked
```
Mapping:  USCorePatientToArgonaut
Source:   USCorePatient
Target:   "http://unknown.org/Argonaut-DQ-DSTU2"
Id:       argonaut-dq-dstu2
* $this -> Patient
* extension[USCoreRaceExtension] -> "extension[http://fhir.org/guides/argonaut/StructureDefinition/argo-race]"
* extension[USCoreEthnicityExtension] -> "extension[http://fhir.org/guides/argonaut/StructureDefinition/argo-ethnicity]"
* extension[USCoreBirthSexExtension] -> "extension[http://fhir.org/guides/argonaut/StructureDefinition/argo-birthsex]"
* identifier -> "identifier"
* identifier.system -> "identifier.system"
* identifier.value -> "identifier.value"
```

#### Defining Mixins

Mixins are defined by using the keywords `Mixin`, `Parent`, and `Description`.

**Example** Defining a mixin for metadata shared in all US Core profiles:

```
Mixin: USCoreMetadata
Parent: DomainResource
* ^version = "3.1.0"
* ^status = #active
* ^experimental = false
* ^publisher = "HL7 US Realm Steering Committee"
* ^contact.telecom.system = #url
* ^contact.telecom.value = "http://www.healthit.gov"
* ^jurisdiction.coding = COUNTRY#US "United States of America"
```

#### Defining Invariants

Invariants are defined using the keywords `Invariant`, `Id`, `Description`, `Expression`, `Severity`, and `XPath`. An invariant definition does not have any rules.

**Example**
```
Invariant:  USCoreNameInvariant
Id:         us-core-8
Definition: "Patient.name.given  or Patient.name.family or both SHALL be present"
Expression: "family.exists() or given.exists()"
Severity:   "error"
XPath:      "f:given or f:family"
```

> **NOTE:** The Invariant is incorporated into a profile via `obeys` rules explained [above](#invariant-rules).

#### Defining Instances

Instances are defined using the keywords `Instance`, `InstanceOf`, `Description`, and `Title`. The `InstanceOf` is required, and plays a role analogous to the `Parent` in profiles. The value of `InstanceOf` can be the name of a profile defined in FSH, or a canonical URL if defined externally.

Instances inherit structures and values from their StructureDefinition (i.e. fixed codes, extensions). Fixed value rules are used to set additional values.

**Examples** 
```
Instance:   EveAnyperson
InstanceOf: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient
Title:      "Eve Anyperson"
Description: "Example of US Core Patient"
* name.given = "Eve"
* name.given[1] = "Steve"
* name.family = "Anyperson"
* birthDate = 1960-04-25
* us-core-race.ombCategory.valueCoding = RACE#2106-3 "White"
* us-core-ethnicity.ombCategory.valueCoding = RACE#21865 "Non Hispanic or Latino"
```

```
Instance:   DrDavidAnydoc
InstanceOf: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-practitioner
Title:      "Dr. David Anydoc"
Description: "Example of US Core Practitioner"
* name[0].family = Anydoc
* name[0].given[0] = David
* name[0].suffix[0] = MD
* identifier[NPI].value = 8274017284
```

```
Instance:   PrimaryCancerDiagnosis
InstanceOf: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/StructureDefinition/onco-core-PrimaryCancerCondition
Title:      "Primary Cancer Diagnosis"
* subject = EveAnyperson
* clinicalStatus = #active
* verificationStatus = #confirmed
* category = CCAT#problem-list-item
* asserter = DrDavidAnydoc
* condition-assertedDate.valueDateTime = 2019-09-13T12:30:00.0Z
* onco-core-HistologyMorphologyBehavior-extension.valueCodeableConcept = SCT#35917007 "Adenocarcinoma, no subtype"
* code = SCT#93864006 "Primary malignant neoplasm of lower lobe of left lung"
